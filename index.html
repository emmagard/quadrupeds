          <h2>FAQs</h2>
          <hr>
          <div>
            <h4>Will you still walk my dog during a snowstorm or in the pouring rain?</h4>
            <p>
            Of course! We work in all weather conditions. In the cases of extreme heat or cold, we take all precautions to make sure your pet has a safe and enjoyable time while under our care.
            </p>
            <h4>Will you dry off my dog so he does not track mudd, water, etc. through the house?</h4>
            <p>
            We are happy to towel dry your doggie after any inclement weather. We simply ask that you
            leave a clean towel by the leash on rainy or snowy days, and we will wipe down paws and dirty
            underbellies as best we can.
            </p>
            <h4>Do you walk dogs in a large pack?</h4>
            <p>
            Never. Our private walks are just that, private. And our group walks are with no more than 3 dogs to each Canine Caregiver.
            </p>
            <h4>What if my dog gets in a fight at play group?</h4>
            <p>
            Our playgroups are well-supervised (no more than 3-dogs to each canine caregiver) but because they are held at a public dog park, incidents can occur. All staff members are trained to deal with such incidents, and are certified in canine first aid and CPR. That said, if your dog is involved in a skirmish, we will contact you immediately, and follow our emergency procedure plan, as laid out in your new client contract.
            </p>
            <h4>Where are your off-leash play groups held?</h4>
            <p>
            Our playgroups are held at the fenced in dog park on Tudor Street in Cambridgeport, or alternatively the dog run at Danehy Park, in North Cambridge.
            </p>
            <h4>For overnight pet sitting services, will you update me as to how my pet is doing while I'm away?</h4>
            <p>
            Our overnight pet sitting includes a daily report for owners. We are happy to email, text, or simply leave a note for you to read when you return home.
            </p>
            <h4>How will I be notified once my dog has been walked?</h4>
            <p>
            Our multimedia Walk Reports are one of our client's favorite features. You choose whether you want to be notified via text message, email, or through a hand-written note. Unless you opt out, you will be sent a walk report at the conclusion of every visit. Our reports let you know where your dog walked, what other dogs he/she walked with, as well as the particulars of any "business" done on the walk. We also frequently include photos of your dog's outing.
            </p>
            <h4>My dog doesn't get along with other dogs and/or has displayed aggressive behavior in the past; will you still accept him as a client?</h4>
            <p>
            We meet with each pet and owner prior to any service. This serves several purposes, one of which is for our Canine Caregivers to evaluate your dog's disposition and assess whether taking part in either semi-private walks or playgroups would pose a risk. In the event that your dog is not approved for playgroups or semi-private walks, we can schedule private walks, and/or one-on-one basic obedience training. Frequently, such dogs can progress to be allowed to partake in group walks or playgroups.
            </p>
            <h4>What payment types do you accept?</h4>
            <p>
            Invoices are sent via Square. We accept credit cards, cash, and check.<br /><br />
